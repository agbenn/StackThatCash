***look at the test file: showMeWhatYouHaveGot.py

import DailyStockData

every function returns a Pandas Dataframe 

df == dataframe the standardized unit of data transactions in python

df.loc[df.someColumn (some boolean operation to select the data you want)]

df.loc[df.someColumn (some boolean combination with | & operators and heavy parenthisis to separate a combo bool]

df.iloc[row,col] (for index operators)

has to look like this for new column creation
df['newColumn'] = df.someColumn * df.otherColumn
not like this 
df.newColumn = some shit
